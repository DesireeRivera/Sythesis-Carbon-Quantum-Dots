### Project Description ###

Sustainable Bottom-up Synthesis of Carbon Nitride Quantum Dots from urea and sodium citrate subjected to a hydrothermal process. Moreover, the analysis and the characterization of the final product were carried out in order to evaluate its behavior and properties as well as ensure quality and 
process reproducibility. Finally, the great potential of this nanomaterial in different areas of biomedical engineering such as medical imaging, therapies or biosensors will be shown.
